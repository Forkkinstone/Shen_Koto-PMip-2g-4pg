I want to tell you about my math teacher. When I was in the third grade, I got a C in mathematics for the first time. I was very hurt at the time. And I decided for myself that I would study mathematics. My math teacher helped me with this. She was the only one who could explain mathematics in simple words in an interesting way. For me, she was not only a good teacher, but also an interesting conversationalist. She told me the secret formulas. And I defended two of my mathematical projects for her. She was the one who helped me write the math exam with more than 80 points.It's been half a year, and I still feel warm towards her.
